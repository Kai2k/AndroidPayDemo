# AndroidPayDemo
A very simple app demonstrating how to integrate Android pay within an app. This app will simulate a shop selling one item. If the user is setup correctly to use Android Pay, a 'Buy with
Android Pay' button will appear. Clicking the button takes the user through the payment flow, with the PaymentMethodToken being displayed to the user at the end.

To see the payment flow in action this app must be run on a physical device with a valid payment card enrolled on Android Pay. At time of writing, Android Pay does not support fake cards. This app will of course not process any real payments!
